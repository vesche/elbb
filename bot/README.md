# elbb Bot

Pure python botting & automation engine featuring a websocket reporting server, task queuing system, and several game automation playbooks. The pyautogui library utilizes [my own fork of pyscreeze](https://github.com/vesche/pyscreeze) which makes pyautogui around 5-10x faster because it uses mss for taking screenshots.
