# elbb Bot

Pure python botting & automation engine featuring a websocket reporting server, task queuing system, and playbook manifest. The pyautogui library utilizes [my own fork of pyscreeze](https://github.com/vesche/pyscreeze) which makes pyautogui 5-10x faster because my fork uses mss for taking screenshots.

python setup.py install --user
